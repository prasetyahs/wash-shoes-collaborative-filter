## Requirements

Slopeone Package requires PHP 5.6+

> **WARNING:** This library may not function correctly on PHP < 5.6.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

The supported way of installing the Slopeone Package is via Composer.

```sh
$ composer require phpjuice/slopeone
```

## Usage

Slopeone Package is designed to be very simple and straightforward to use. All you have to do is to load rating data, then predict future ratings based on the training set provided

### Loading files

The `Slopeone` object is created by direct instantiation:

```php
use PHPJuice\Slopeone\Algorithm;

// Create an instance
$slopeone = new Algorithm();

```

### Adding Rating values

Adding Rating values can be easly done by providing an array of users ratings via the update() method:

```php

$data =[
  [
    "squid" => 1,
    "cuttlefish" => 0.5,
    "octopus" => 0.2
  ],
  [
    "squid" => 1,
    "octopus" => 0.5,
    "nautilus" => 0.2
  ],
  [
    "squid" => 0.2,
    "octopus" => 1,
    "cuttlefish" => 0.4,
    "nautilus" => 0.4
  ],
  [
    "cuttlefish" => 0.9,
    "octopus" => 0.4,
    "nautilus" => 0.5
  ]
];

$slopeone->update($data);

```

### Predicting ratings

all you have to do to predict ratings for a new user is to run the slopeone::predict method

```php
$results = $slopeone->predict([
            "squid" => 0.4
          ]);
```

this should produce the following results

```php
[
  "cuttlefish"=>0.25,
  "octopus"=>0.23333333333333,
  "nautilus"=>0.1
];
```

## Running the tests

you can easly run tests using composer

```bash
$ composer test
```
